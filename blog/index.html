      It is important to understand why the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_3" target="_blank">
        PS3</a> failed. The perspective here was juniorish dev working on simulation and
      rendering in triple-A. I remember less than I knew and knew less than most.

      What I can provide here is the hindsite of someone who actually developed and shipped titles on the PS3.

    <b>
      The PS3 failed developers because it was an excessively <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heterogeneous_computing" target="_blank"> heterogenous</a> computer;
    </b>
    and low level heterogeneous compute resists composability.

    <h2>
      More like multicore than many
    </h2>

        alt="PS3 heterogeneous diagram">
      First off you didnt get the full 8 SPUs as a (game) developer. Out of the 8 SPUs one was disabled due to die yield
      and the
      OS got a core and a half. While this changed with updates one only really got 5-6 SPUs to work with. The Xbox in
      contrast had what amounted to 3 PPUs (2 more). So the Cell really featured at most 3 more (difficult to use) cores
      than the Xbox360.
    </p>

    <h2>
      Computationally weak components
    </h2>

    <p>
      The claim from wiki is a SPU has 25 GFlops and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSX_Reality_Synthesize"
        target="_blank"> PS3 GPU</a> has 192 GFlops. If you absolutely maxed out your SPU
      usage
      you would still not even be close to the power of the underpowered PS3 GPU. For contrast the xbox360 gpu had 240
      GFlops. The GPU of the PS3 has separate Vertex and Pixel shading. In contrast, the XBox360 was shared.
    </p>

    <p>
      As a game developer these Flops numbers reflect the experience of developing on these respective platforms. This
      was
      particularly noticeable in something like post processing where the demands of the vertex unit are very low (large
      quads).
    </p>

    <p>
      Due to the weakness of the GPU vertex unit people would use the SPUs to do skinning.
      The pixel shading unit did not have constants. So one would also have to do shader patching on the SPUs before
      these
      programs could be sent to the GPU. All of these things require synchronization between the CPU, SPU and GPU and
      interact with workload balancing. In retrospect I also assume that dynamic branching in the shader was either
      impossible or prohibitive so this is why everyone did excessive shader permutations. (XBOX360 supported wave
      operations and I used this feature back in the day)
    </p>

    <h2>
      Simple compute models
    </h2>

    <p>
      While the Cell could behave more like a supercomputer I saw it mostly used more like generic GPU compute. I never
      saw production code that did anything but dispatch N jobs from the PPU. I never saw direct inter SPU communication
      even though I recall such a thing was possible (mailboxes). This is similar to how GPU inter workgroup workloads
      are
      more rare and difficult.
    </p>

    <p>
      Even the PPU was quite different from an SPU. The SPUs had only vector registers; the PPU had fp, gp, and vector
      registers. Is this really bad? No but it makes everything more heterogeneous and therefore more complex. Getting
      maximum performance out of these SPU units means that you were likely doing async DMAs while also doing compute
      work.
    </p>

    <h2>
      Sharp edges
    </h2>

    <p>
      The PS3 had 512 Mb total memory but 256 MB was dedicated to graphics and only had 8 Mb/s access from the CPU. So
      this means in addition to the 256 MB purely for graphics you would also have to dedicate system memory for
      anything
      that was written to and from the GPU. The point here is inflexibility and heterogeneous nature.
    </p>

    <p>
      The PS3 had cool features but these were never general purpose and could only be exploited by careful attention to
      detail and sometimes significant architectural changes. I recall using depth bounds for screen space shadowing and
      one could probably use it for a few other similar gpu techniques (lighting). There was also the alluring double z
      writes which is a one off for depth maps if you dont actually use a pixel shader. I don't recall all the edges
      but they were sharp and it meant performance cliffs if one strayed off them.
    </p>

    <h2>
      The Challenge of Local memory
    </h2>

    <p>
      Of course the challenge that everyone knows about the SPUs is the constraint of memory access to local memory. You
      got 256Kb but in reality once you factored in stack and program you were probably down to 128Kb. This
      computational
      model is far more restrictive than even modern GPU compute where at least there you can access storage buffers
      directly.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Most code and algorithms cannot be trivially ported to the SPU. </b>
      C++ virtual functions and methods will not work out of the box. C++ encourages dynamic allocation of objects but
      these can point to anywhere in main memory. You would
      need to map pointer addresses from PPU to SPU to even attempt running a normal c++ program on the SPU. Also null
      (address 0x0) points to the start of local memory and is not a segfault to load from it.
    </p>

    <p>
      Instead of running generic code on the SPU, what developers did was write handcrafted SPU friendly code for heavy
      but parallelizable parts of their engine. With enough talent and investment you can eke out the full compute
      power of the PS3. Of course this is maybe easier as a first party developer as you can at least focus on this
      exotic hardware and
      craft your engine and game features around the type compute availible. This is why Naughty Dog famously came so
      close to showing us the full potential of the console.
    </p>



    <h2>
      What it could have been
    </h2>

    <p>
      Had the PS3 been what was originally designed it would have been a much more exotic but much less heterogeneous
      machine.
    </p>

    <p>
      The original design was approximately 4 Cell processors with high frequencies. Perhaps massaging this design would
      have led to very homogenous high performance many core architecture. At more than 1 TFlop of general purpose
      compute
      it would have been a beast and not a gnarly beast but a sleek smooth uniform tiger.
    </p>
    <p>
      One has to actually look at the PS3 as the
      <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20091201-00/?p=15843" target="_blank"> licked cookie of </a>
      many core designs. This half-baked half-harted
      attempted
      that became synonymous with the failure of many-core. I used to think that PS3 set back many-core for decades, now
      I wonder if it simply killed it forever.
