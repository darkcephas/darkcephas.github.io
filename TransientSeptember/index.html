There was a book I read as a kid called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wump_World">The Wump World</a>. The story featured peaceful wombat-like creatures that lived undisturbed on a lush green planet. Along come some heavily industrialized, overly numerous aliens that ravage the surface. The atmosphere and environment quickly becomes a toxic ruin and the aliens all leave for a yet another target of their desecration. The wumps emerge from their hiding as new life germinates in the cracks of concrete.

<p>The normies are leaving the internet. They are moving on to their places. Tik-tok, Instagram, Amazon; the non-internet.  </p>
<p>They leave behind a devastated internet. A ravaged landscape of ads, bots, and spam. </p>
<p>Let them go! Cyberspace was never their space and they were  <a href="https://www.eff.org/cyberspace-independence#main-content">never welcome among us.</a></p>

<p>In their absence, Something new is being reborn</p>
