we need a data file that contains triangles (facing) and color + maybe emissive

We can import this every frame -> all triangles

Each Cell will have N triangles. This will be ~100s at most. 
We process all the triangles in || each thread has a ray and then tests against a triangle.
Thus we only load the trangle into workgroup memory once. We can easily do 256 rays at once.
Most of the rays will go to other cells. We can have per input cell slots (no sync) or just 1 cell one slot for all of rays.

Based on syncronization concerneds we will have each workgroup propagate rays independently.
However it will do so on a cell by cell basis. So there will be room for N (1000) rays per cell. 
We can support overflow buffers as well. We can do indirection to one larger location for the actual ray data.
The overflow rays buffer is processed when we have a lack of work to do. This makes everything more cache coherent.
